  subtitle: "[door banging] I don\u2019t know how to get out. I can\u2019t finish
    maths! I don\u2019t know my way out of this labyrinth! I can\u2019t open this
    door! This is really annoying! I\u2019ve died like seven times! I absolutely
    HATE maths! But I shouldn\u2019t say it too loud because the STUPID MANNEQUIN
    SHOWS UP! [exasperated sigh] Dammit! \u2026. I wonder where that other guy is?"
